# Flying Helicopter
## Description
The goal of this project is to build a flying helicopter using only HTML and CSS. We will learn how to use animations and transform properties to create a flying helicopter. We will also learn how to use the @keyframes rule to create smooth animations.

## Css Properties used in this project
- `@keyframes`
- `Tranformations`
- ` Animations`
## what I learned
-`@keyframes`: is used to create a set of style for animation. 
-`Transformations`: is used to change the shape of an element.
-`position : absolute`: The element position is determined by the top, right, bottom, and left properties. Also the elment  is positionned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element.
