# Flying Helicopter :helicopter:
## Description
The goal of this project is to build a flying helicopter using only HTML and CSS. We will learn how to use animations and transform properties to create a flying helicopter. We will also learn how to use the @keyframes rule to create smooth animations.

## :book: Css Properties used 
- `@keyframes`
- `Tranformations`
- ` Animations`

## :bricks: How we built the project
In the `HTML` file, we created a div for the helicopter cockpit, a div for the helicopter rotors, a div for the helicopter body, and div for the helicopter tail.

In the `CSS` file, we create three animations: 
- `rotor-spin`: This animation is used to make the rotors spin.
- `fly`: This animation is used to make the helicopter fly from one position to another.
- `bounce`: This animation is used to make the helicopter bounce up and down.

## :brain: what I learned from this project 
-`@keyframes`: is used to create a set of style for animation. 

-`Transformations`: is used to alter the appearance of an element. With transformation properties, we can change size, rotate,skew and move elements.

-`position : absolute`: The element position is determined by the top, right, bottom, and left properties. Also the elment  is positionned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element.

-`z-index`: is used to specify the stack order of an element. An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.

## :end: Conclusion 
 This project was great to begin with animations and transformations in CSS. I looked forward to learning more about these properties and how to use them to create more complex animations.
